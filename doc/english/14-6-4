To whom it may concern:

Over the last few months, I have become increasingly alarmed by the untidy and even unhygienic state of the office staffroom and kitchen. Having voiced my concerns in staff meetings, only to have been ignored, I felt I had no choice but to take my complaint to the office management team.

I will begin with the trash cans. It seems that the trash cans are emptied at most once a month. Quite frankly, they are disgusting. They are constantly overflowing with rubbish and stink terribly. Furthermore, they are a hygiene risk.

The fridge in the kitchen is no better. I do not think it has been cleaned once since I joined the company five years ago. Some of the leftover food in it is alive. On opening the door, the onlooker is confronted with a horror show.

Finally, the carpets in both rooms are old, dirty and very dangerous. Having tripped on them numerous times, I can attest to this. They simply must be replaced.

In short, the staff areas are becoming absolutely intolerable. I urge you to do something about this as soon as possible.

Best regards,

Tabitha Ecclestone
